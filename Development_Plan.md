## High-Level Game Plan: FHIR Medication API Backend (Standalone)
### Goal: Build a standalone Django + GraphQL API that exposes FHIR-aligned medication data, syncs with OpenFDA, and is cloud-ready for use by external apps.

## ✅ Phase 1 — Core Features (DONE or in progress)
 - [x] Django project + app scaffolded
 - [x] Medication model with FHIR-aligned fields
 - [x] Management command to sync from OpenFDA
 - [x] GraphQL API with query & mutation support
 - [x] Unit tests for model + sync
 - [x] GraphiQL explorer for easy local testing

### 📍You are here.

## 🚧 Phase 2 — Feature Hardening
| Task	| Description | Status|
| -------- | ------- | ------|
🔍 Add filtering to GraphQL	| Let clients search medications by code, name, manufacturer
🛡 Add authentication	| Add django-graphql-jwt (or Cognito/Auth0) for mutation protection
♻️ Pagination & sorting	| Add GraphQL pagination support if needed by frontend
💾 Add to_fhir() or FHIR export |	Optional: expose FHIR JSON structure per medication
🧪 Write tests for GraphQL	| Verify GraphQL query/mutation logic
🐳 Dockerize app	| Prep for cloud deployment (gunicorn + nginx + .env setup)

## ☁️ Phase 3 — Cloud Integration
| Task	| Description | Status|
| -------- | ------- | ------|
🚀 Deploy API	| Use Render or AWS EC2 to make your API live
⏱ Automate sync job |	Wrap import_fda_data in AWS Lambda or GitHub Action (scheduled)
📊 Add monitoring |	Integrate Sentry or CloudWatch for errors/logs
🔐 Secure deployment |	Configure CORS, environment variables, auth tokens
📄 Write OpenAPI/GraphQL schema doc	| Optional: auto-document your API for external consumers

## 📦 Phase 4 — Make It Consumable
| Task	| Description | Status|
| -------- | ------- | ------|
📡 Enable CORS |	So the Spezi app and chatbot can access your GraphQL API
📑 Write frontend instructions |	Add a section in your README for frontend teams on how to query your API
🧪 Validate with external client	| Test your deployed API with Postman, GraphQL client, or chatbot code
